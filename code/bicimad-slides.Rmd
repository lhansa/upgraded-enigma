# Introduction

## What is Bicimad?

- Bicimad is the public service of electric bicyles at Madrid. 
- The [data](http://opendata.emtmadrid.es/Datos-estaticos/Datos-generales-(1)) about use of these bikes was made public a few months ago.
- It consists on around 2,000 electric bikes parked at several stations. 
- The cost depends on how long the user cycles before parking again (50 cents per 30 minutes).
- The stations are not only in the historical center, but there are no stations on the outskirts of the city.

## The origin of the data

The files include anonymized data about every route a Bicimad bike has made.

## Dealing with the data

- The data consist on one compressed json file per month
- In the future, a web scraping process (Selenium) can be prepared for the downloads.
- For now:
    1. We downloaded the data,
    2. uncompressed the files 
    3. and read the json files with R


## The data that we used

- Zip code of the cycler
- Time spent with the bike per route
- Geoinformation about the route (geojson format)
    + Origin station (codified)
    + Arrival station (codified)
    + Coordinates (points, not lines)
    
**Remark.** All the codes used are storaged [here](https://github.com/lhansa/bicimad). 

# Zip codes

```{r mes-id-zipcodes, include=FALSE}
mes_id <- "201808"
```

## First comments 

- **Idea.** We would like to understand relations time cycling and where the user lives. Do people living outside the center cycle longer than people living in the outskirts? 
    + This would be related about the idea of the bikes replacing public transport or walking.
- We have restricted the analysis to people with a validated zip code from the region of Madrid (about half of the total data: 135.000 routes on August 2018).
- The only routes taken into account are the ones done by users, not workers.

## Some remarks

- Cyclers from zip codes with more than 1,000 routes in one month have cycled 90% of all of the routes.
- We have disregarded the zip codes with less than 1,000 routes, so that atypical behaviours due to small sampling are avoided.
- All the zip codes with more than 1,000 routes associated are inside the city of Madrid.

```{r lectura-df-tiempos, include=FALSE}
df_tiempos <- read_rds(glue("data/df-tiempos_{mes_id}.rds"))
```

## About the next graphic

- We'll see the distribution of the median time spent on the bike, by zip code where the cycler lives. 
- We want to see who makes longer trips. 
- The color depends on the number of routes taken by the cyclers from that zip code.

## Median time on bike per Zip Code

```{r tiempo-zip-code, include=FALSE}
q1 <- function(x) quantile(x, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
q3 <- function(x) quantile(x, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)

df_zipcode_tiempos <- df_tiempos %>% 
  filter(
    str_detect(zip_code, "^28"),
    !zip_code %in% c("28", "28000"), 
    str_length(zip_code) == 5
  ) %>% 
  mutate(tiempo = tiempo / 60) %>% 
  group_by(zip_code) %>% 
  summarise(
    min = min(tiempo), 
    q1 = q1(tiempo), 
    media = mean(tiempo), 
    mediana = median(tiempo), 
    q3 = q3(tiempo), 
    max = max(tiempo), 
    movimientos = n()
  ) 
```


```{r median-time-per-zc-plot, echo=FALSE}
df_zipcode_tiempos %>% 
  filter(movimientos > 1000) %>% 
  arrange(mediana) %>% 
  mutate(zip_code = as_factor(zip_code)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = zip_code)) + 
  geom_col(aes(y = mediana, fill = movimientos)) + 
  # geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = q1, ymax = q3)) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```

## A few insights 

- Cyclers from outside the center spent more time on the bikes. 
    + This may be the related to the fact that they use the service for going to neighbourhoods different from theirs. 
- We should bear in mind that, for people living in the center of the city, there is no need on going to the outskirts. 
- People from central zip codes seem to be using the bikes more times than people from other zip codes (28012, 28005, 28015, 28004) 

## Another point of view

- The data includes an ID for user and day. 
- We will focus on the relation between the time a user cycles in one day (not in one route) and his or her zip code. 
- We have exluded zip codes with less than 100 users (5% of the total daily users).

## Median time on bike per day and Zip Code

```{r median-time-day-data, include=FALSE}
df_mediana_usuarios <- df_tiempos %>% 
  filter(
    str_detect(zip_code, "^28"),
    !zip_code %in% c("28", "28000"), 
    str_length(zip_code) == 5
  ) %>% 
  mutate(tiempo = tiempo / 60) %>% 
  group_by(zip_code, user_id) %>% 
  summarise(tiempo = sum(tiempo)) %>% 
  summarise(
    min = min(tiempo), 
    q1 = q1(tiempo), 
    media = mean(tiempo), 
    mediana = median(tiempo), 
    q3 = q3(tiempo), 
    max = max(tiempo), 
    usuarios = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mediana))
```

```{r median-time-day-plot, echo=FALSE}
df_mediana_usuarios %>% 
  filter(usuarios >= 100) %>%
  arrange(mediana) %>% 
  mutate(zip_code = as_factor(zip_code)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = zip_code, y = mediana, fill = usuarios)) + 
  coord_flip()
```

## Some insights

- Again, users from outside the center will use the bike more time. 
- In median, people cycle between 15 and 20 minutes per day:
    + Use not associated with long distances.
- There are more users in the center, which is where the majority of the stations are found. 
    + But correlation does not mean causation, so we don't know if expanding the service will imply an increasing in the number of users.


# Routes visualization

## First comments

- **General idea.** Distribution of the routes on a map. The target is spotting cycling patterns.
- We use routes taken both by workers (blue) and users (red).
- The visualizations are made by weekday.
- We will focus on two particular months.


```{r func-pinta-mapa, include=FALSE}
pinta_mapa <- function(fecha_guay){
  coordenadas %>% 
    filter(weekday == fecha_guay) %>% 
    mutate(hora = as.character(hora)) %>% 
    leaflet() %>% 
    setView(lng = -3.695, lat = 40.425, zoom = 13) %>%
    addTiles(options = providerTileOptions(opacity = 0.35)) %>% 
    addCircleMarkers(
      lng = ~long, lat = ~lat, 
      color = ~color, stroke = FALSE, 
      fillOpacity = ~tiempo, 
      radius = 2, popup = ~hora) %>% 
    addGraticule(style = list(weight = 0))
}
```

# Next steps

## Next steps

- Scrape the website for automate the downloading of the data.
- Use twelve months.
- Study distributions per hours.
- Separate annual users and sporadic users.  
- Focus on routes taken by workers.
- Identify strange routes.
- Guess the location of each station id.
- Analyse the data at a user-day level.

## Next steps

- Analyse the speed (are the cyclers using the electric mode or aren't?).
- Explore the return trips on a same day for a same user.
- Simplify the reading of geojson data.
- Understand the relation between cycling and good/bad weather.
- Study deviation of the data time, not only aggregated results.
